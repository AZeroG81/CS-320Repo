Questions:

1. How can I ensure that my code, program, or software is functional and secure?
    To ensure that the software being created is in proper working order, I could review each line of code and run the program over and over again until there are no         errors. However, that is not the most time efficient way to do this. Creating sotware tests is the more efficient way to test the program, software, or code for it's     functionality and stability.
2. How do I interpret user needs and incorporate them into a program?
    Having a clear line of communication with the party who contracted out the creation of the software is the best way to understanding the needs or requirements of the     software. Additionally, thinking outside of the box, or understanding the exact process could ensure that what is being created is appropriate for the intended           audience.
3. How do I approach designing software?
    I approach designing software much the same way I approach many things, logically. I like a clean and precise code, and I like to have a functional product before I can even put it away from time to time. I spend countless waking hours writing code and it can be exhauting. I feel that, in the future, I should approach software development and design with a little less hyper-focus, and more with a sense that there is still plenty of time to complete. However, getting it done early is also a good practice to get into. Waiting until the last possible minute is not a good habit to get into, because of the unforseen nature of coding. Errors can cause the entire project to malfunction, and waiting can make finishing on time even more of a deficit.
